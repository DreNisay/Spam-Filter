Implemented Na√Øve Bayes Classifier to train the program to identify spam and ham messages


Background of Spam Messages
Spam messages may be one of the most used types of scamming devices ever since emails and text messages were introduced. To counter and avoid these spam messages, a program must be trained to identify and classify whether the email it read is a spam message or a ham message.

The project also gives the results for True Positives (spam classified as spam), True Negatives (ham classified as ham), False Positives (ham misclassified as spam), False Negatives (spam misclassified as ham), together with the precision and recall of the algorithm.

The training data used for the algorithm is retrieved from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection and partially was used to test if the algorithm works
